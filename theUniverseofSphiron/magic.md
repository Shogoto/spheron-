#Magic
This article is about magic and briefly goes over other subjects related to it.

##1.Magic, Wild Magic, and Chi/Mana

Magic is a force that exists in all life, matter, energy and time. Through it we can manipulate the elements in a limited way with our chi (the personal magic of our bodies), or by other means such as enchanted objects.

You can find magic in three different forms: bound magic, free flowing magic, and condensed magic (wild magic). An example of bound magic would be a magitite ruby charged with magic. Free flowing magic flows through the air forming little currents and circuits that look very much like thin, blue strings (to those who can see it). This magic is very small and week. Most beings don’t even notice it, let alone see it.

###What is Wild Magic

Okay, this is when magic starts getting really fun... but, before I get into all the neat things wild magic can do, we need to learn a little something about magic itself. You see, magic has this unique property of being attracted to itself (like water). Though this attraction is small, it’s none the less there. This is a very fortunate thing, because, if you think about it, if magic wasn’t attracted to itself strong enough we wouldn’t be able to use it, and if magic was to strongly attracted to its self, we’ed get concentrated magic forming around all sorts of things. <-That would be very bad.

“Why?” you might ask? Well, you see- concentrated magic has this nasty habit of making weird and unpredictable things happen - normally resulting in destruction and mayhem (Though that would be very cool, we’re all glad this doesn’t happen on a regular basis). Interestingly enough, this concentrated form of magic actually has a name. We call it: *Wild magic*. That’s right, now you know what wild magic is (concentrated, crazy, free magic). “Okay,” you might be thinking, “we know what wild magic is, but you just said that magic isn’t attracted to its self strong enough to normally concentrate like that.” You are absolutely right!, good for you!

Okay. Consider a single, free particle of magic flowing through the air. There are other particles moving all around it but our particle is pretty much just ignoring them as it travels through space. Now lets say that as our magic particle is traveling, minding it’s own business, it collides into another magic particle. At this point the particles would most likely just bounce off of each other (which magic particles are always doing) but lets say our two particles collided with one an other in just the right way where they “stuck” together. This is how magical streams or strings are formed. As the two (or more) particles travel through space they tend to collect and attract more magic to it’s self. This is because the group’s magic level is higher together then apart **(Note:** *Magic can neither be created or destroyed so the amount of energy present in the group is equal to the sum of each individual’s power. The group’s energy level is simply higher as a new distinct body then when they were separate. Just thought I should make that clear.* **)**. Magic is always being drawn into streams because of their energy difference, and thrown out because their bonds are so weak. Magic streams always flow towards a higher concentration of magic.

So, the basic point is that *normally* magic doesn’t condense to form wild magic, but there are some exceptions. Well, how does magic condense to form wild magic then? -Mostly through unnatural means, but there are a few natural examples of wild magic I can show you.

##Wild Magic
Wild magic can be found deep in the earth or flowing in thick rivers deep in ocean trenches. Often the cause of wild magic in an area is magic seeping up from the earth. This in turn attracts more magic from the environment and can be dangerous. “How the heck did all this magic get so deep in the earth anyway?” you might ask. I have no idea. But it is theorized that magitite is one of the components that make up the core, and due to certain disruptions, magic escapes and gets forced up.

In places where wild magic persists, it is actually visible. It looks like blue, swirling mist and gives off an eerie glow. Casting magic in ‘the mist’ amplifies the magic being cast, sometimes in an uncontrolled and dangerous way. Another dangerous aspect of casting in wild magic is that the spell can react with the concentrated magic changing the nature of the spell in unpredictable ways.

Long exposure to wild magic can also be dangerous because it starts reacting with your chi. It can shift your appearance, give you random powers, cause you to hallucinate or simply amplify your chi. If an exposed creature moves away from 'the blue mist' it's body will eventually restore itself to it's original state, but its eyes will always have an eery glow.

Some examples of over exposure to wild magic could be: A person floating a foot above the ground and is unable to magically or physically bring himself back down; Become impervious to water; Your hair to catch on fire; your skin to randomly changes colors.

Even though all this sounds cool, it’s not a good idea to stay to long in wild magic lest it overpower your system via saturation. Long time exposure to wild magic can cause insanity, kill you, increase your power capacity (which isn’t necessarily a bad thing), cause you to permanently hear voices speaking to you in your head, spontaneously combust, cause you to dream while you are awake but fail to have dreams while you are asleep, and other equally strange and disturbing things.

Doesn’t wild magic sound fun?

Now we come to the most lethal kind of wild magic of all. Do you remember, at the beginning of this section, I mentioned something about “thick rivers of magic flowing at the bottom of deep trenches on the ocean floor”? Well, these rivers of magic run so thick it’s as if they’re water. And if you were unfortunate enough to come into contact with this wild magic, it would suck away all your mana and then immediately disintegrate you.

What?, - “why”? Why do you think!? Magic is attracted to higher concentrations of magic. The wild magic in this example is most definitely a higher concentration then the magic in your body.

###Chi
Now lets talk about chi, also known as mana. Chi is the personal magic of our bodies. -I think I already mentioned that somewhere- It is what allows you to cast your magic and protects you from foreign magic manipulating your body, mind, soul and life-energy (called qi) changing you back to your original state if you are compromised (that’s why spells eventually wear off).

Chi travels around in your body in little stream like currents, before exiting through chi gates on your skin. Mana generates in your gut area, because of consumption (you’ll find out latter why), and spirals out from your core to fill your whole body. You might be wondering how magic is able to flow around in your body in the first place. Well- perhaps you have heard of a little mineral called magamite (maj-uh-might). Magamite is a mineral found in rocks and the soil. This mineral has a unique ability to hold on to magic; but unlike *magitite*, magamite is willing to share its power with others. When magamite comes in close proximity with other magamite, magic literally starts jumping between the two as if they were one.

When you eat a plant or animal you’re not just getting the nutrients or the fuel for combustion... You see, plants grow in the ground, and the ground is composed of soil, dirt, rocks and minerals. And guess what- magamite is one of those minerals! Well, when a plant sits in the ground, it gets its business partners, the mycorrhiza fungus, to help it absorb nutrients, water and minerals from the soil. Well, when an animal eats a plant some of those nutrients, water and *minerals* get absorbed into the animal. And when an animal eats an animal, some of *those* nutrients, water and *minerals* get absorbed into that animal too!

After consumption, magamite gets absorbed and stored in your liver, making it the highest concentration of magic inside your body. After being stored in the liver it makes it’s way into your blood, causing the magical currents within your body. Now, these magic currents *don’t* follow your blood stream. Instead the magic chooses to spiral out from your body, swirling out from your core. The magamite absorbed in your blood doesn’t ‘hold’ onto the magic in your body, remember? Instead it allows the magic to flow through it.

Your body regulates how much chi is to be in your system by your chi gates. Unbeknownst to you, your skin contains a lot of magitite, as does your bones. This magitite helps hold all your magic inside you. Well, your chi-gates are little concentrations of magecite and magamite sprinkled all over your body. If you were put under a Garter-Force lamp it would look like you had millions of little blue freckles all over your skin (those are your chi gates). If you have excess mana they allow extra mana to escape. When you need to charge up to cast a spell, they restrict the amount of mana flowing out. *(If you want to know more about this process, checkout the **“Casting Magic”** section)*

When your mana flows out it doesn’t just “disappear”. You see, your chi network doesn’t stop at the surface of your skin; but flows out, twisting around your body in lucid spirals that form your aura, and then travel back in. Your aura helps protect you by catching foreign magic in its currents and throwing it out again. Unfortunately, when this happens you lose a bit of your own magic as well and your body has to replenish it.

Because you have a higher magic concentration in your body then the environment you’re normally standing in, your body tends to attract the foreign magics around you. This poses no problem however, because, fortunately for you, your body possesses an aura. Interestingly, your aura changes in intensity according to your mood. This translates into different colors for thous with the power to see it.

The amount of chi you have, called your *chi level* or *mana well*, dictates how strong your aura is, how much magic you can cast and, along with your will, how quickly you can recover from an offending spell. Your chi level also determines how strong your aura is.

Now this doesn’t mean that if your chi level gets so high, that bullets will bounce off your chest and you’ll be completely impervious to magic. -Uh, no. To much power will destroy your body. If anything, the amount of mana you have on hand only dictates how quickly a spell will wear off, your slight resistance to magic, and how much magic you can cast before having to rest and charge back up.

The rate you are able to recover your mana is determined by your *chi recovery rate*, or *mana restoration rate*. It also dictates how quickly you can charge up to cast a spell. Your body is always replenishing your mana because your magic is always getting depleted. This is because your mana is in constant motion and tends to accidentally get kicked out, or flung out, while it’s traveling around in your body. The greatest amount of your mana is lost when it flows out and around you in your aura before flowing back into your body.

Your *magic power* describes how potent your spells are. This has nothing to do with the amount of magic you can throw out at your target, but is a factor of your control and precision with magic. Another factor in this business is your magical orientation...

###Magical Orientation
Your magical DNA regulates the amount of different elemental magamite that is in your system, determining your magical orientation. (mDNA is very interesting but we will not go into it here. So you’re just going to have to contain your enthusiasm and wait.) “Well, what is a magical orientation, and what does magical DNA have to do with it?” you may ask. Well think about it. If your body absorbs more magamite elemental earth then magamite elemental gravity, you would be able to convert more of your magic into earth magic and cast it better then gravity magic.

So you could say that you are better at casting earth magic then gravity, or that earth has a higher hierarchy then gravity.

You see, you have a hierarchy of magics in your body (elemental magic is often referred to as “the magics”). The highest is called your *dominant* magics. Next is your *auxiliary* magics, *tertiary* and then your *sub*, with everything else being inferior.

Here’s a picture to show you what I mean:
####Hierarchy - Orientation examples
*Dominant- Water
*Auxiliary- Body
*Tertiary- Earth
*Sub- Fire
*Inferior (in no particular order)- Wind
*Inferior- Bile
*Inferior- Gravity
*Inferior:- Electricity
*Inferior- Light
*etc...

Your orientation also governs what elements you are most resistant to and what elements you are weakest to. If your dominant magics is fire, then you will have the highest resistance to fire magic. If your auxiliary magics is mind magic, you will have the second highest resistance to it. And so on and so forth...
(If you are curious about the elements and their weaknesses, I have written all about it in section **2.The Elements**.)

Now let me just make something clear. Just because one of your magics, lets say water, is inferior, it does not mean that you are going to be hopelessly terrible at casting water magic. It just means that you aren’t going to cast it as well -at least at first. If you spent all your time into practicing water magic and ignored all your other magics, I’m most definitely sure that you would become much better at casting water magic then anything els. In fact you could say that you switched your dominant magical orientation to water. And yes, if your orientation changes, it changes your resistances as well.

“Whoa, wait,” -you might ask, “Your orientation can change?” -And yes. Yes it can. When your body realizes that you are using more of one kind of element, it starts absorbing more of that elemental magamite from your environment (like from what you eat, or through the skin and stuff). Of corse, if you stop casting it long enough, you’ll start going back to your default orientation.

Interestingly, not all races have a dominant, auxiliary, tertiary, sub and inferior magics. Sprites only have a dominant and inferior magics witch they cant change. Imps aren’t born with a dominant magics at all; whatever they choose to use the most they become the best at.

“Well this is all interesting and good, but how do you even *cast* magic in the first place?” I’m glad you asked...

###Casting Magic
The short story for doing all that has to do with your chi gates. First your chi gates constrict the outward flow of you mana. This causes the flow inside you to spiral tighter together and start spinning faster within you, raising your magic energy level. Well your body can only hold so much magic before it starts harming you. When your body has charged up as much as it can take, your magic starts spilling (or leaking) out into your aura. Now, because your inner magic energy level is much higher then it usually is, the extra chi rushing out into your aura doesn’t just flow away, but contributes to thickening your aura, making it visible and look like swirling smoke or blue flames or something (or swirly smoking blue flames). At this point your magic is now potent enough to cast.

A quick warning before we move on. Right when you first start charging up your magic, your aura potency drops for a short instance, because your chi gates are withholding magic. Even though it is just for a split second, this is when you are weakest to magic and someone with very good timing can do a lot of damage to you. Conversely, when you have charged up your manna to the point where you can see it, you are the most resistant to it.

“All this is good and all,” you may think, “but I want to know how your body is able to cast magics like electricity and stuff. Or healing magics?” Again, it has to do with your chi gates. Remember, your chi gates are made up of magitite and magamite. There is a reason magamite is in your chi gates. Magamite is elemental remember. I think it’s time we go into a little more detail about this.

We really didn’t go into much detail about this before, but do you remember me mentioning that if you could see your chi gates, it would look like you were covered in blue freckles? Each one of these “freckles” is a chi gate, and each chi gate is made up of tones of cells that contain magitite and magamite. If you looked at a single chi gate under a Garter-microscope it would look like it was made up of three rings. The outer ring is made up of concentrated magitite, the second is made up of concentrated magamite, and the center is practically void of any magitite *or* magamite. Each chi gate can only hold one kind of elemental magamite. When your manna is fully charged and ready to be released, the magitite sealing the mana gates with the type of elemental magamite that you want to cast relaxes. The magamite stays constricted, acting like a filter, and so changes the form of the magic being cast. 

Your mana well, mana restoration rate, magic power, and magical orientation is all referred to as your magica.

###mDNA
Now we come to your magical DNA (mDNA). Yaaaay!

Your mDNA controls all aspects of your magical composition: your magica, magics, powers and chi. Not only that but it’s your magical DNA that turns you back to your natural state when magic compromises you in any way.

“Wow, mDNA is really neat!” you might think, “but how can it accomplish so much when it’s just made out of magic?” Well, that’s just it. mDNA *isn’t* made out of magic. mDNA, is in fact, made up of deoxyribonucleic acid (pronounced Dee-ox-ee-rie-bow-Noo-clee-ic acid).

Do you remember When we discussed magical orientations?

##2.The Elements

Magic is divided into 16 elements, or 16 magics. All the elements are organized into four groups: The elements of time, the elements of energy, the elements of matter and the elements of life. In turn, each elemental group contains four of that element’s magics.

The ellements of Time are past, called *tā*, present (*jā*), future (*tsar*) and ray (*rā*). In the elements of Energy are gravity (*bō*), electricity/light (*stō*), heat/fire (*tsoy*) and (*jē*). The elements of Matter are water (*kē*), earth (*tō*), bile (*bīl*), and air (*shō*). And then the elements of Life are spirit (*tow*), mind (*sī*), qui (*kwē*, the energy of life) and body (*shā*).

###The Elements of Time
Of the elements of time, there is present, future, past and something called “ray”, which basically is “uniformity of nature” or “consistency of the basic laws and principles of the universe through time”.

Ray is more like a concept or fact then an element that you can control. The only being who has power over ray is the creator, the God of Logos and Order. Another way to think of ray is the reality that you live in. If someone could control ray, they would have power over all the universe and even the process of thought itself. Ray is the eldest in the elemental group of time.

Time is unpredictable and the hardest element to control. Actually, you can’t really control it. You can’t change or manipulate the past or future with magic. The only thing you can do with the elements future and past is watch; they can only be used to look forward or backward in time, but this does not mean that they are not useful.

####Future:
Future magic is forbidden. All visions of the future come from Sphiron Himself. Any attempts to divine the future outside of His power is witchcraft, and punishable by death.
####Past:
Past, like all time magic, it is very difficult to master or control.
Descry is the easiest time magic to control. When cast, the vision of the past is sensually triggered. For example, when descry is cast, it allows you to perceive the past by learning the history of an object you come in contact with via site, sound, taste or touch. This magic is a (..) magic. In other words it requires a continuous flow of magic to work. Normally when someone casts descry they cast a touch-descry, because it is easer to control. Witches often use fore-descry to try to divine the future.
Glimpse allows you to look into the past, but it is unreliable because it is hard to find exactly what you are looking for at the right time in the right place etc...
####Present:
Present magic either briefly warps and bends the present time, or is used to spy on people.
Spy allows someone to watch someone or something els in the present time.
Slow is usually cast on someone other then you. It causes the person to subsequently move slower then the present time. To the affected persons point of view, everything is going faster.
Fleet Foot causes the person to move faster then the present time. To the affected persons point of view, everything is going slower.
Stop freezes the person in time. It is generally considers a more powerful version of slow. It takes a lot of magic to cast and maintain. This magics usually wears off pretty quick.
Time Fields affect everything in an aria, either inflicting slow, fleet foot, or stop.

Past, present and future is neutral. It has no weaknesses or resistants.

The Elements of Energy
Of energy there is gravity, electricity/light, and fire (or heat).
All of witch is pretty self explanatory. But one interesting thing to note is that energy magics has phases which correspond to magic strength. Gravity is considered the eldest in this elemental group.
Bō
Gravity magic is mainly used to move things around. It can also be used to crush things, teleport, make thing very light, very heavy or hold things in place. Gravity does’t really have phases.
Weaknesses	Resists
Earth 3/10	All Energy 6/10
Water 2/10	
Bile 2/10	
Gravity 2/10	
Wind 1/10	

Stō
Light magic can be used to illuminate a dark room, create a mirage, suck all the light out of a room (and therefore make it dark), zap something or burn a hole in it via laser-beam.
Light is the smallest magics in the light/electricity element. Basically this entails moving light around (like illuminating or darkening a room), or, if you’re really good at small magics, braking up the light wave to create a picture or render something invisible.
Counters to Light	What Light Resists
Gravity 9/10	Electricity 5/10
Light 5/10	Fire 2/10
Electricity is a different form of the light/lightning elemental group, and is considered a medium magics. It’s pretty strait foreword. You zap things.Though electricity is rather hard to control, or make it go were you want (especially in the event that there is water and metal nearby. If you get wet it is recommended that you don’t try to cast electricity. It takes a lot of will to weald electricity.
Counters to Electricity	Resists
Earth (metal) 3/10 (redirects)	All Energy 2/10
Water (liquid) 3/10 (redirects)	
Gravity 4/10	
Beams are the strongest, or highest form of the stō elemental group (electricity/light). It is basically a beam of light instead of a wave. Mages highly concentrate the beam so as to burn holes through their opponents.
Counters to Beams	Resists
Earth (shiny metal) 10/10 (as long as it is shiny it should redirect the beam)	All Energy 2/10
Earth (stone) 3/10 	
Earth (crystals) -5/10 (intensifies the beam)	
Gravity 2/10	

Tsoy
With fire magic (or heat) you can burn things. You can use it to heat up an object, or cause it to burst it into flames, or consequently, take heat away from things, cooling it off. It’s easer to burn inanimate objects then living things, witch resist magic. Instead casters combust the air around the creature they wish to burn. This is smart considering that air is very flammable.
Counters to Fire	Resists
Water 4/10	All Energy 2/10
Earth 3/10	Bile 3/10
Gravity 2/10	Wind 5/10

The Elements of Matter
Of matter are water, earth, bile, and air.
One thing you should know is that it is extremely hard to change your magic into something physical, like matter. Instead casters choose to use their magic to manipulate the mater already around them. -But it can be done.
Water is the eldest element in this elemental family.
Kē
When casters use water magics, they don’t just go around getting people wet. They use ALL the phases of water. This includes shooting ice shards at you, making fog and manipulating steam... and yes making you wet. ...No you can’t walk on water. You have to use gravity if you want to do that.
Weaknesses	Resists
Earth 2/10	Bile 3/10
Fire 1/10	
Gravity 2/10	
Electricity 5/10	
Tō
Earth magic is a bit more diverse then moving dirt around. Metal, crystals, earth, rocks and dirt can all be manipulated by earth magics.
Weaknesses	Resists
Electricity 4/10	Fire 5/10
Water 2/10	Wind 2/10
Gravity 3/10	
Bīl
If the name “bile” confuses you, don’t worry. It confuses me too. Basically it’s just the group where all the acids and poisons are placed in. Don’t ask me who decided to call it bile. Who ever they were must have been an idiot because bile (the green stuff in your stomach) is alkaline, not acidic. -Though alkaline stuff can be pretty embracive.
Weaknesses	Resists
Water 6/10	
Gravity 2/10	
Shō
Air. Yah, you can make wind and blow things around. But don’t allow this elements illusion of being weak deceive you. If you have the skill, you can suck the oxygen strait out of a room, or out of someones very lungs. Air is also very resistant to electricity. Trust me, you’re not an electricity mage’s friend.
Weaknesses	Resists
Fie 6/10	Electricity 7/10
Gravity 2/10	

The Elements of Life
And of the elements of life are spirit, mind, qui (pronounced “kwee”, the energy of life) and body.

Obviously, you cant “make” life, or a thinking mind, a true body, or a spirit (witch is a living being). Instead the only thing you can do with life magic is manipulate it.

Qui is the eldest in this elemental group.

A quick note: life magic is weak to it’s exact element (it self: mind to mind, body to body etc...). It has no weakness or resistance to any other magic. Your resistance to a specific life element is determined by your constitution and magica. 

A spirit is a living being with a thinking mind. Spirits lack the energy force qui, witch physical creatures need to live. Being unphysical being, they don’t need it.

Mind magic is used to sense what a thinking being is abut to do, read his thoughts, communication telepathically, hypnosis to control an others actions, or to create illusions of emotional feelings or sensations.

Qui is the life energy of all physical, living creatures. A body without life is a corps. You can give life to someone and heal them, or suck it away.

Shape shifting governs the element body, either shape shifting yourself or another body’s body. You can’t shape shift a non living thing into a living thing, or a living thing to a non living thing -unless it’s already dead. Also, if you shape ship a body without a mind (like a tree) into something with a mind it’s not going to think strait. Turning an animal into one of the races does not turn it into a being. Beings have a spirit (a soul). Animals do not. And if you think about it, when you shape shift something, you’re not changing what it is, just its bodily form. Eventually, anything that has been shifted will change back into its original form.

Well, that’s about all you need to know about magic. The rest of the article briefly touches on things that are related to magic, such as enchanting, magical diseases, etc...

3.Spells & the Different Magical Classes

Witches
A witch is a person who worships a demon(s). Witches are extremely hard to kill. They have strange powers, an almost endless supply of chi, their wounds automatically heal and once you do manage to kill one they turn undead! The only way to really get rid of one is to burn it’s body, but even then you have to worry about it’s spirit abandoning his body and attacking everyone.

Necromancers
There are two different classes of Necromancy: The old, or traditional form and a newer, more commonly known form that branched out from the traditional. The traditional form dealt primarily with trying to divine the future through communication with the spirits of the dead (witchcraft), and prolonging life. The newer form deals with the control of the dead’s bodies and manipulating life. This form developed as a result of a necromancer’s delving into the secrets of life in the serch for prolonged life (sound innocent enough?\:-/ ). These ‘new’ Necromancers control the undead and can summon the living horrors of chaos. They tend to prefer close combat or physical attacks via undead to get around magical defenses.

Sorcerers
Sorcery also branched out from Necromancy. Sorcerers capture and enslave spirits as well as people’s souls, bending them to their will. Sorcerers often bind spirits and lesser demons in there mala beads wound around their wrist to use for later. They are also known for communicating with the dead and consorting with demons.

Mages
Mages are people who have trained their bodies in the art of manipulating the magical energies inside them. Mages specialize in the elements of matter and energy.

Mystics
Mystics are people who have trained their bodies in the art of manipulating the magic inside them. Mystics specialize in the elements of life and time. Healers, Seers, Shifters, Magicians, Necromancers, and Sorcerers are mystics.

Wizards
Wizards have mastered something from all four elemental categories and are very rare (and often very old).

Enchanter
An enchanter infuses elemental magic into items giving them special properties. Usually he uses magic crystals and stones to accomplish this, or script to charm the item. An other term for an enchanter is magics weaver.

Magicians
Magicians specialize in illusion and the realm of the mind. They use a lot of enchanted objects to do their craft. Magicians aren’t really taken seriously in the magical world. They usually use their magic for entertainment.

4.Other Mystical & Magical Things
Animals
There are many exciting animals with magical properties in the univerce of Sphiron. Here are just a few of them.

Dragon

Plants

Gumgoa Tree- The Gumgoa tree is a magical tree that floats above salt water and dangles its roots in the water. It will try to anchor itself to anything solid, even its neighboring Gumgoas. The name comes from Sea, of the Nazzi people’s dialect, and means “flying tree”. The tree’s wood is often used in magic channeling assistants like staves and wands to increase the potency of thier gravity magics. Can survive in both cool and tropical climates provided there is enough precipitation or water.

Fay Tree- Only found on Sky and Night, this tree is covered in little luminous buds. The trunk and branches look to be decked in stars. This tree has black bark, with leaves that are an almost black green color on it’s underside and nearly white on top. It is found in swamps with a definite change in seasons.

Star Branch Tree- The star branch’s flower buds glow like little stars, but when they open the flowers are black with white, glowing centers and stemma. Tecnically Star Branches aren’t really plants, since they don’t use photosynthesis. Only found on Night and in cold climates.

Pugoa Bush- (poo-go-ah) A plant only found on Sea. It’s name means “little floater”. This shrub grows in the ground or rock, and then after blooming the plant floats up into the sky to propagate its seed. It prefers wormer climates but is found all over.

Tah-k-tah flower- Tah-k-tah is from a fay language meaning moon. The Tah-k-tath is a giant plant found on Sea, Effulgence and Sky. Its leaves can get up to 10’ in length and width. Its flower, when blooming, can reach up to 11’ in height; the petals of witch glow and are 5’ long. This plant is only found in shady and tropical climates, growing in water or mud.

Echgoa vine- (ech-go-ah, the ch is a hissing consonant) Means floating snake. The Echgoa is a vine that has a bulbous floating pod looking thing, called the head, situated at the end. The vine part anchors the plant to the ground. There are many different verities of echgoa. The plant has () leaves that () up to the head, while the head itself has five large leaves on the top. During its seeding season, the head bursts into bloom.

Awah-ha plant- This plant’s flowers can only be seen on the full moon. The petals look like glass, glowing faintly in the moonlight. On rare occasions the flowers will glow red. This can happen during a lunar eclipse or if there is a lot of iron in the soil. The Awah-ha plant likes clod climates and is often found in the mountains.

Rocks
(magamite [elemental stones, used to change pure magic into its elemental form], magatheral [like magamite, except a metal and neutral] magitite [looks like a ruby, used to store magic or spirits, also elemental], and magecite [crystal, used like a wire, neutral])

Enchanted, Charmed, and Mystical Items

An enchanted object is an object infused with an elemental power by magical stones and crystals.

A charmed object is an object that has a spell woven into it via some kind of magic script, giving it the power to perform a specialized task.

A mystical item is an item that has a bound spirit within it, giving the item strange powers and a personality of its own. To make things a bit more confusing, sometimes enchanted and charmed items are referred to as being “mystical” too. \:-/


Magical Diseases

Zombie
A zombie is a soulless corps that goes around trying to eat everyone (its how the disease is spread). There are two different types of zombie corpseus diseases. One you can get while you are still alive which eventually kills you, turning you into a zombie, and one that can infect your corpse after you've died -which is more common.

Vampire
A vampire is a corpse that leaves its grave at night to drink the blood of the living by biting their necks with long sharp canine teeth. If you are bitten by a vampire but somehow survive there is a chance that you could become infected. The infection kills the victim turning him into a vampire. Vampirism is caused by a magical, mutinous, corpseus disease infecting the blood.

Vampires have the ability to shape shift into small bats, allowing them to hide up high and spot out their pray.

During the day they hide out in caves or dark places to escape the burning rays of the sun. Other then the sun, the only way to 'kill' a vampire is to destroy the heart, poison it with silver, "starve" it to death (which is not recommended), or to burn its body with fire.

 A starving vampire is very dangerous. If a vampire goes on too long without feeding (like years and years) it will turn into a hunger, which is like a skeletal, berserked, blood-thirsty, crazed vampire. To find more information on vampires look in “The Book of the Dead” by Rice.

Twilight
Twilights are people who have been bitten by a vampire, almost died, started to turned into a vampire from the bite, but yet are able to miraculously fight off the disease at the last moment and receive some vampiric traits.

Twilights are very rare. They have the ability to shape shift into a very large bat and have super heightened senses. The sunlight hurts their skin but doesn't burn as severely as it does for vampires. They crave the blood of vampires and often go out hunting at night when vampires are most active. As a result, vampires hunt twilights relentlessly. On Earth in Tolm, On-Ti, and the Wi Hoe islands, Twilights were greatly revered and considered good luck. In the Ball-Ail pantheon, there was a lesser-god reported as being a twilight and worshiped as the great protecter.

Werwolf
Werwolfism is a disease that turns a person into a wolf-like creature once a month, periodically causes him to loose his mind and go on a destructive rampage. The sight of the moon is the main cause of triggering this behavior, but stress and fear have also been known to trigger it. If you get bitten you will catch the disease as well. It is basically a lycan disease (lupus-lycanthropy) where the subject’s magical DNA gets confused on which form is the persons true form, and forces him to shape shift.

Mutant
Mutinous diseases are caused by eating an infected animal or getting attacked by a mutant. You start growing grotesque growth and can loose your mind. Originally thought to be caused by over exposure to wild magic, it is now debated wether or not it is even a magical disease.
