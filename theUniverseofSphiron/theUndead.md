##Zombie
The definition of a zombie is rather broad. It is basically a soulless body, not necessarily the result of a disease; doesn’t even have to be a dead body. For instance, a corps under the control of a necromancer is considered a zombie as well, the person doesn’t even need to be dead! -As long as the body has no soul.

But what most people think of when they hear the word “zombie” is a cadaver infected with a corpsus diseases. There are many magical creatures in this marvelous universe, but rarely are they thought of on the microscopic level. There are two corpsous diseases that result in what most people think of as a zombie. An airborne one, which is only dangerous if your immune system is already compromised or weakened, and one spread through bights or liquids.

The first cace of corpsous disease usually results in a very mild zombie, covered in a fuzzy substance like mould. This zombie mainly just walks around releasing it’s spores and wont bother you unless you get to close to it or you bother it. They are mostly rotten, and old ones will disintegrate when struck, releasing thousands of spores in the process.
Symptoms- your skin will break out in a leprous like disease; will result in terrible white sores that may become so bad that they will result in the twisting your face and body, your skin will become white, flaky and itchy. You will have a cough.

The other kind of zombie is what horror films are made of. These zombies are aggressive and will hunt you down if aware of you. This is because this disease is spread through the bight, or drinking infected water and other liquids. They are still rather weak though. And are only really dangerous in large numbers where they can overwhelm you. The really bad thing about this corpsous disease is that it can infect cadavers (already dead people), and will crop up in places where there are a lot of exposed dead bodies like battle fields.
**Symptoms-** tiredness, lethargy, achiness in the joints, bones and muscles.

**(List of Other Zombies)**
* The common zombie (listed above)
* Mutanous zombies 
* Vampires

##Mutanous Zombie
This is another corpsous disease resulting in a zombie possessing rather diverse extraordinary properties. This can rang from super strength, speed, extra limbs, heightened senses, being able to jump to extraordinary heights, etc... Generally having a twisted form, and being more vigorous then most other zombies; except maybe the vampire. If an outbreak is present, you may catch this disease if you have any exposed wounds or get injured by one of these zombies. This corpsous disease also infects cadavers.
**Symptoms-** pain in the muscles and joints; joints and body parts will become inflamed. You will start vomiting blood later on when closer to death and transmutation.

##Vampire
Of all the kinds of zombies, vampires are probably one of the most interesting. Unlike the other zombies, vampires retain the personalities, memories and aspirations of their host before his death. One of the first things vampires usually do after “awaking” is go after the ones that were closest to them and proceed to feed off of them or simply kill them.

Vampirism is a very unique mutinous corpsous disease. After the disease kills the host it proceeds to change the corps in very specific ways. All vampires have elongated canine teeth which continue to slowly grow longer over time (which allows you to guess there age), and heightened senses. They are also extraordinarily light and have varying degrees of amplified strength, speed, and hypnotic powers. But what is most interesting is that every vampire has the ability to shape shift into a small bat.

Weaknesses all vampires tend to share is a sensitivity to sunlight. It causes them extreme pain and burns there skin. The little organisms that cause the pathogen die in sunlight, and if the vampire stays in the sun to long his skin will start to rot. Other then the sun, vampires tend to be a bit flammable and have a natural fear of fire, so will avoid it.

Different strands of the disease emphasize different talents and weaknesses of the vampire and is passed down from victim to victim. For example, one strand my produce vampires with extraordinary speed, much faster then other vampires. While another my pass down a talent that isn't very common to vampires at all, like shadowing, the ability the blend into the shadows and not bee seen.

A starving vampire is very dangerous. If a vampire goes on to long without feeding (likes years and years) it will turn into a hunger, which is like a skeletal, berserked, blood-thirsty, crazy vampire bent on nothing but to suck your blood.

##Revenant
A revenant is an animated corpse, who returns from the grave to terrorize the living either for revenge or as an attempt to escape hell. Those who return from the dead are wrongdoers in their lifetime, often described as wicked, vain or murderers.
Often the revenants are associated with the spreading of disease among the living. The appropriate response is usually exhumation, in the case of a ghost, followed by some form of decapitation, and burning or removal of the heart. For skeletons the only way is to hack it to pieces and to burn its remains.
Stories of revenants were very personal, always about a specific individual who had recently died (unlike the anonymous zombie).

##Leich
Leiches (lie-ch) are the result of a powerful necromancer, or individual, striving for eternal life using spells or rituals to bind his soul to his animated corpse and thereby achieve a perverse form of immortality. Leiches are depicted as being clearly cadaverous (as opposed to the healthier forms of vampires), their bodies desiccated or even completely skeletal. Leiches are often depicted as holding power over hordes of lesser undead creatures ( the cace of necromancers), using them as their soldiers and servants, and thus are a threat both individually and as leaders of belligerent forces.

##Abominations
Abominations are bound souls; but unlike revenants who are held back by their regrets, abominations are forced to remain by some outside force, like a sorcerer. Abominations aren’t always trapped in there own body. Often necromancers attach an assortment of other body parts from different animals and such, to create a kind of monster.

Abominations are usually used to guard things.

#Living spirits
\*Since ghosts are immortal (can't die or become sick) the only way to get rid of them is to either banish them to the spiritual realm or bind them in an object.\*

##Ghost
A ghost is a person's soul who is trapped in this world for some reason or other. At first ghosts act like the same person they were before they died, but souls go insane without a body, so after a while they either turn into a phantom or a specter.
Some ghosts are able to keep their sanity by 'sleeping'. Ghosts will go inside an object with walls, like a jar or a room, and inter into a sort of hibernation. This is called haunting.
Activity in the house causes the ghost to 'wake up' so it drives away any person that enters it's 'resting spot'. No one knows why living in a container helps, but some speculate it gives the impression of being in a body, but no one really knows.
Haunting doesn't work forever though, the ghost will still go insane, it just prolongs their sanity.
There is one other way a ghost may keep it's sanity. When a person dies protecting a loved one, his love may be so strong that he stays in this world to continue and protect that loved one. It seems to give them a purpose. When it's loved one finally dies they will both leave for the after life together.
When a ghost has a purpose it seems to be easier for it to keep it's sanity.

##Phantom
A phantom is a lost soul that usually floats around moaning and howling in misery. They're not really "dangerous" but they can attack and are easily upset. Mentally unstable so if you see one don't approach it.
A banshee is a phantom that was a female when it was alive. It is said that a banshee's wailing warns of an impending death in a home.

##Specter
Specters are vengeful spirits and will attack you without warning. Ghosts can't actually touch you but they can drain your life energy away, or throw things at you, and if you are weak they can try to possess you.

##Wraiths
Wraiths are VERY dangerous and very cunning. They have been known to hunt down and devour other people’s souls and can suck the life force out of any adversary.
Notorious power hunters, often described as wrongdoers in their lifetime, they can usually be found floating around crypts and ancient runes looking for power.

##Geich
A geich is like a wraith but lacks its cunning, having been murdered before birth.
Not being born, the baby has never experienced love or hate, just the comfortable warmth and safety of his mother's womb. If his mother issues the command to abort her baby and he is killed, his soul may become so shocked that it becomes a vengeful spirit, killing it's mother. Not knowing love, the only thing he has experienced is murder so he continues to kill and 'feast' upon other people's souls.

##Seek
Seekers are powerful sorcerers who have found a way to steel and posses other people's bodies in an attempt to achieve a corrupted form of immortality. When the body they have taken becomes old or not to their liking they move on to another one.
